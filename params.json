To concat videos :\r\n\r\n```\r\nffmpeg -i \"concat:$OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.avi|$TEMPORARY_FILE_NAME.avi\" -c copy $TEMPORARY_FILE_NAME_VIDEO.avi\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `-i \"concat:$OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.avi|$TEMPORARY_FILE_NAME.avi\"` take videos to concat, you can add more if you like between |\r\n* `-c copy` will copy all video streams without reencoding \r\n\r\nYou can find more information on ffmpg here https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html\r\n\r\n<hr/>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
